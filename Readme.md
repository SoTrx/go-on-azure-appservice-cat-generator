# Go on Azure appservice - Cat generator 

Live demo : https://demo-cats-api-go.azurewebsites.net/


This repo is a proof of concept on using Go on appservice, using containers.

The application itself just sends random cat images.


go build -o ./build/cat-generator .\src\
## Configuration
This app accepts one env variable 
+ **API_KEY** : [Thecatapi.com](https://thecatapi.com) API Key. It's in fact not needed by the API endpoint used but the APP checks for it at boot anyway.


## On the custom appservice runtime

To work as any other webapp, two requirements must be fulfilled :
+ There must be a process listening to port **80** to handle HTTP requests. 
(Although this is customizable via the **WEBSITES_PORT** env variable). An nginx reverse-proxy in this case. 
+ An SSH server must be available, using port **2222**. As the Azure portal will login as root, the root password must
be fixed to **Docker!**. To prevent this from being a security flaw, the app is running as a non-root user, and *should*
have no way to switch user, even knowing the password.  


Having these two requirements fulfilled, the remaining Dockerfile is focused on building the smallest possible image :
+ The builder step is cross-compiling the app to `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, as the target is alpine, which as no glibc support out of the box.
+ The release step is installing the runtime dependencies and copies the stripped and upx'ed app. 
The final image is 18MB.
